Unconstrained log-likelihood (without tree): -30573.6209
Number of free parameters (#branches + #model parameters): 516
Akaike information criterion (AIC) score: 127957.4877
Corrected Akaike information criterion (AICc) score: 128071.9822
Bayesian information criterion (BIC) score: 131338.3099

Sum of internal branch lengths: 9.0884 (14.0362% of tree length)

Tree topologies are unlinked across partitions, thus no drawing will be displayed here

ALISIM COMMAND
--------------
To simulate an alignment of the same length as the original alignment, using the tree and model parameters estimated from this analysis, you can use the following command:

--alisim simulated_MSA -t Qplant.F8.treefile

To mimic the alignment used to produce this analysis, i.e. simulate an alignment of the same length as the original alignment, using the tree and model parameters estimated from this analysis *and* copying the same gap positions as the original alignment, you can use the following command:

iqtree -s <alignment.phy> --alisim mimicked_MSA

To simulate any number of alignments in either of the two commandlines above, use the --num-alignments options, for example mimic 100 alignments you would use the command line:

iqtree -s <alignment.phy> --alisim mimicked_MSA --num-alignments 100
